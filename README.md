## What Are Candlestick Charts?

Candlestick charts consist of individual "candlesticks," each
representing a specific time period (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour).
Each candlestick displays four price points:

-   Open: Starting price of the period
-   Close: Ending price of the period
-   High: Highest price during the period
-   Low: Lowest price during the period
